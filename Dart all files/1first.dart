void main() {

  //similarly you can't assign value to a variable which
  //doesn't matches its data type also the string values
  //should be assigned within the double quotes
  //example:
  // lastname = 3;  This is wrong cause it's value isn't enclosed in double quoate
  lastname = "3"; /* this is correct*/
  print(lastname);
